LeetCode Solutions
This repository houses my personal solutions to a variety of coding problems from the LeetCode platform. As a developer, I've found LeetCode to be an invaluable resource for practicing and improving my problem-solving skills, which are essential for technical interviews and coding challenges.

The solutions contained here cover a wide range of topics, including arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more. Each solution is accompanied by a brief explanation of the approach taken, as well as an analysis of the time and space complexity.

While these solutions may not be the only or even the optimal way to solve the given problems, they represent my own thought process and coding practices. I hope that by sharing them, I can not only keep track of my own progress, but also potentially help others who are on a similar journey to improve their algorithmic and coding abilities.

I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or alternative solutions you may have. Feel free to submit a pull request if you'd like to contribute to this repository.
